# Online Profile

This repo was designed to elaborate on details about my career and projects that don't necessarily make it into a typical CV/LinkedIn page (at least not in such a flexible format!).

I am glad you are here. I plan to talk about myself. A lot :)

If you are reading this as a potential employer then I truly hope you find it an enjoyable experience. Let us chat when you have seen enough to convince yourself that I am your guy!

Best Wishes

Kyle Goddard
